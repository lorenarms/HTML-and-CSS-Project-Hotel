<h1>Project: Hotel Site</h1>
<p>This project was completed using a Udemy course as a guide. This was my first project using HTML and CSS, and is a sampling of basic design techniques I have learned from the course so far. More projects will follow, stay tuned...</p>
<p>The site is hosted <a href="#">here</a> so you can view it online.</a>
